# Master_Thesis_Brage_G_S

This is the code used for the different proposed HADs in Brage Gaas√∏ Samsonsens Master Thesis. 

## Files

The RGAE_py/ folder contains the different HADs utilizing the Interpolated Autoencoder.

The RGAE_mat/ folder contains the preprocessing based RGAE, the MK-RGAE and the RGAE with modified layer setups. 

## IMPORTANT !!!

### RGAE

Everyting regarding the default Robust Graph Autoencoder (RGAE) is taken from [Github Link](https://github.com/FGH00292/Hyperspectral-anomaly-detection-with-RGAE). 
This RGAE is based on the papers "Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection With Robust Graph Autoencoders" and "Hyperspectral Anomaly Detection With Robust Graph Autoencoders", both by G. Fan et al.

### KPCA

Everything regarding KPCA is taken from [Github link](https://github.com/xiangyusong19/SSIIFD_Hyperspectral-Anomaly-Detection/tree/main/Demos_full-pixels_detection?fbclid=IwAR16aahWpTO-_kgc1CuVpv9Y1mBGRn716N_U9lbiHi1m2ZSVMDOF14aAD9g).
The authors of this code are X. Song et al.
