# RGAE_python
A python interpretation of the IGAE, K-IGAE and the MK-IGAE (as well as the conventional RGAE)


## Datasets
Datasets must be placed in the datasets/default/ folder. If you want to use KPCA, you need to save the KPCA of the datasets you want to use in a folder withing datasets/.

## Files

To run a python script, make sure to run it from the "RGAE_py/" folder. Then simply run the file by typing "run <file_name>" in the terminal.

To run the IGAE or the K-IGAE, the "IGAE_and_K-IGAE.py" and the "IGAE_and_K-IGAE_automation.py" can be utilized. Remember to specify the correct inputs in the python file.

To run the MK-IGAE, run the "MK-IGAE_automation.py"
